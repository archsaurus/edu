Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why do we use it? It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content 
of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal 
distribution of letters, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page 
editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites 
still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose 
(injected humor and the like).

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 
and 1.10.33 from 'de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum' by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, 
accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

1.10.32: “Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit...”
1.10.33: “... nisi obstat quod...”

You can also find Lorem Ipsum on various social media platforms: @lorem_ipsum, #loremipsum, and more!
Keep in mind that Lorem Ipsum is not suitable for everyone, especially when trying to convey a specific type 
of message.
